Important Changes
=================

  It has now been nearly 6 months, I have removed the deprecated features listed below in master.
  I will release 0.9.2 shortly, with these features removed.

  With The release of version 0.9.0 I have officially deprecated Garb::Report, Garb::Resource,
  Garb::Profile, and Garb::Account. Garb::Report and Garb::Resource should be replaced by Garb::Model.
  Garb::Profile and Garb::Account are supplanted by their Garb::Management::* counterparts.
  
  I'll be working hard to update the documentation over the next day or so to highlight all of the
  old features in the new classes, as well as any new features brought by the new classes. If you
  are looking for something in particular, please open an issue and I will try to prioritize these
  requests.

  Please read CHANGELOG

Description
-----------

  Provides a Ruby API to the Google Analytics API.

  http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/gdataDeveloperGuide.html

Basic Usage
===========

Single User Login
-----------------
  
    > Garb::Session.login(username, password)
    
OAuth Access Token
------------------

    > Garb::Session.access_token = access_token # assign from oauth gem

Accounts, WebProperties, Profiles, and Goals
--------------------------------------------

    > Garb::Management::Account.all
    > Garb::Management::WebProperty.all
    > Garb::Management::Profile.all
    > Garb::Management::Goal.all

Profiles for a UA- Number (a WebProperty)
-----------------------------------------

    > profile = Garb::Management::Profile.all.detect {|p| p.web_property_id == 'UA-XXXXXXX-X'}

Define a Report Class
---------------------

    class Exits
      extend Garb::Model

      metrics :exits, :pageviews
      dimensions :page_path
    end

Get the Results
---------------

    > Exits.results(profile, :filters => {:page_path.eql => '/'})

  OR shorthand

    > profile.exits(:filters => {:page_path.eql => '/'})

  Be forewarned, these numbers are for the last **30** days and may be slightly different from the numbers displayed in Google Analytics' dashboard for **1 month**.

Get all Results
---------------

Google Analytics returns 1000 results at a time. To paginate over all results:

    > Exits.all(profile) { |exit| ... }

Other Parameters
----------------

  * start_date: The date of the period you would like this report to start
  * end_date: The date to end, inclusive
  * limit: The maximum number of results to be returned
  * offset: The starting index

Metrics & Dimensions
--------------------

  **Metrics and Dimensions are very complex because of the ways in which they can and cannot be combined.**

  I suggest reading the google documentation to familiarize yourself with this.

  http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/gdataReferenceDimensionsMetrics.html#bounceRate

  When you've returned, you can pass the appropriate combinations to Garb, as symbols.

Filtering
---------

  Google Analytics supports a significant number of filtering options.

  http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/gdataReference.html#filtering

  Here is what we can do currently:
  (the operator is a method on a symbol for the appropriate metric or dimension)

  Operators on metrics:

    eql => '==',
    not_eql => '!=',
    gt => '>',
    gte => '>=',
    lt => '<',
    lte => '<='

  Operators on dimensions:

    matches => '==',
    does_not_match => '!=',
    contains => '=~',
    does_not_contain => '!~',
    substring => '=@',
    not_substring => '!@'
    
  Given the previous Exits example report in shorthand, we can add an option for filter:

    profile.exits(:filters => {:page_path.eql => '/extend/effectively-using-git-with-subversion/')

SSL
---

  Version 0.2.3 includes support for real ssl encryption for SINGLE USER authentication. First do:

    Garb::Session.login(username, password, :secure => true)

  Next, be sure to download http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem into your application somewhere.
  Then, define a constant CA_CERT_FILE and point to that file.

  For whatever reason, simply creating a new certificate store and setting the defaults would
  not validate the google ssl certificate as authentic.

TODOS
-----

  * rebuild AND/OR filtering in Garb::Model

Requirements
------------

  * crack >= 0.1.6
  * active_support >= 2.2.0

Requirements for Testing
------------------------

  * shoulda
  * mocha
  * bourne
